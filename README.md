# Website osm2pgsql.org

This is the source code for the website of the osm2pgsql software at
[osm2pgsql.org](https://osm2pgsql.org).

It is written using the static web site generator
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

To run it locally, you need Ruby. Then check out the repository and install
Jekyll:

```
git clone https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql-website
cd osm2pgsql-website
gem install bundler jekyll
touch contact.md
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You'll then have a local version running on `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`.
