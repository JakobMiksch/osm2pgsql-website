I'll be giving two talks about osm2pgsql soon. Both will be online. The first
is at the German language [FOSSGIS
conference](https://www.fossgis-konferenz.de/) which takes place from June 6th
to June 9th. The second is a the English language [State of The
Map](https://2021.stateofthemap.org/) from July 9th to 11th. Both talks will
focus on new developments in osm2pgsql. You'll need to register with these
events to see the talks, but they will be available for free later.
