title: Release 1.6.0
---

This is a bugfix release with only minor changes.

Changes:

* The osm2pgsql-replication script which has been included in the osm2pgsql repository for a while will now be installed together with its man page on "make install". To use it you need Python3, psycopg2 (or psycopg3), and PyOsmium installed. See [the manual](https://osm2pgsql.org/doc/manual.html#keeping-the-database-up-to-date-with-osm2pgsql-replication) for details.
* Ignore relations with more than 32.000 members (which should never happen in real data) instead of failing.
* Removed the dependency on boost::algorithm.
* Included libosmium was updated to newest version 2.17.3 which contains an important fix for a problem which can lead to osm2pgsql locking up.

Note that this is the last version which will compile with C++14. The next version 1.7.0 will need C++17. (We have postponed the switch to C++17, because we wanted to get these bug fixes out early.)
