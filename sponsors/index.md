We need more and ongoing sponsorship to keep osm2pgsql as a reliable and modern
software. If you want to help, contact a developer of your choice directly. We

We are currently not set up to receive small donations. If you want to donate
small amounts of money, we suggest you support the [OpenStreetMap
Foundation](https://osmfoundation.org/){:.extlink} or one of its local chapters.
